## Ways to Recover a Google Account

Start at the official recovery page: https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery (g.co/recover). Below the methods are grouped by whether they require you to actively provide/access something (user assistance) or can work by Google recognizing existing signals without supplying new recovery factors.

### Methods that require user assistance

(You must provide or access something to complete these)

1. Recovery phone number

- You must have access to the linked phone to receive the SMS or voice verification code. Enter the code to verify and reset your password.

2. Recovery email

- You must have access to the configured recovery email to receive a code or link and use it to verify and regain access.

3. 2‑Step Verification backup codes / authenticator / security key

- Use previously saved backup codes, an authenticator app code, or a security key in your possession to complete verification.

4. Try another way / identity questions

- You must answer prompts such as the last password you remember, approximate account creation date, or personal account details. These responses come from you.

5. Restore a recently deleted account

- If you deleted the account, you must act quickly via the recovery page and follow the restore prompts (typically within ~30 days).

6. Appeal for disabled accounts / Google One support

- If the account was disabled or you need personalized help, you must complete forms or interact with Google One support (submit details, follow up):
  - Disabled account appeal form: https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/disabled2

### Methods that may work without additional user-provided recovery factors

(Google uses existing signals — you still need to attempt recovery, but you may not have to supply new codes or new accounts)

1. Previously used device, browser, or familiar location

- Attempt recovery from a device, browser, and Wi‑Fi network you’ve used before. Google treats these as trusted signals and may accept your sign-in attempt without extra factors.

2. Google automatic checks and risk signals

- Google evaluates device history, IP/location consistency, cookies, and other passive signals. If these match prior activity, recovery is more likely to succeed without supplying new external verification.

### Notes and safety

- Never share verification codes, passwords, or private keys with untrusted parties.
- Avoid third‑party services that promise to bypass Google security — they are unsafe and likely scams.
- If official recovery options fail, follow Google support guidance and appeals; provide as accurate details as possible when prompted.
